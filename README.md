# Mail-Automation-Project
#### This project automates the process of letter-creation [sent] via email. 
#### The code creates an individualized letter using the template provided in the “starting_letter.txt.” 
#### For each name in the invited_names.txt, we replace the [name] placeholder with the actual name of the person. 
#### The letters are then saved in the folder “ReadyToSend.”
